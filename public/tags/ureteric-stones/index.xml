      <description>Majority of uncomplicated distal ureteric stones can be managed conservatively by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), hormones, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, and alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker drugs. Oedema and ureteral spasm are two important contributing factors causing retention of stone. Objective of this study was to assess the outcome of using (NSAIDS) and alpha blockers in the conservative management of distal ureteric stones. Total number of patients in this prospective study was 120 and study period was 15 months.</description>
