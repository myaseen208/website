      <description>The current research was conducted to exploit the adaptability/resistance status of different sesame varieties/advanced lines of sesame germplasm against charcoal rot under different environmental conditions through AMMI Biplot analysis. Ten varieties/advanced lines of sesame viz., TS-5, 10003, 40009, 50009, 50011, 50022, 16001, 40004, Black Till and TH-6 were collected from Ayub Agricultural Research Institute (AARI), Faisalabad, Pakistan. The seeds of sesame varieties/advanced lines were sown at six different locations namely Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh, Piplan, Bhakhar, Mandi Baha Uddin and Bahawalpur with three replications under Randomized Complete Block Design.</description>
