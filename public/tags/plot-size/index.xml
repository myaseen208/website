      <description>The present study was designed to estimate the optimum plot size with the shape for field research experiments on paddy yield trial considering the effect of plot size on variability in yield of crop as well as studying the coefficients of variation of different plot sizes and shapes of plots. The Smith&amp;rsquo;s index of soil heterogeneity was computed to estimate optimum plot size and shape using yield data of the 12m�24m recorded separately from each basic unit of 1m�1m (288 basic units).</description>
