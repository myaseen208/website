      <description>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which pledges to “leave no one behind,” emphasizes on promoting full and equal participation of all vulnerable and marginalized population segments in national development efforts, including persons with disabilities (PWDs). There is mounting evidence globally that differently abled people are disproportionately more vulnerable to both monetary and multi-dimensional poverty and require urgent support in terms of targeted social protection measures. The present paper presents a situation analysis and estimates of the population of PWDs across Pakistan, using different available data sources.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Optimum Field Plot Size and Shape in Paddy Yield Trial</title>

      <description>The present study was designed to estimate the optimum plot size with the shape for field research experiments on paddy yield trial considering the effect of plot size on variability in yield of crop as well as studying the coefficients of variation of different plot sizes and shapes of plots. The Smith&amp;rsquo;s index of soil heterogeneity was computed to estimate optimum plot size and shape using yield data of the 12m�24m recorded separately from each basic unit of 1m�1m (288 basic units).</description>

      <title>Studying the impact of farm mechanization on wheat production in Punjab-Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://myaseen208.com/publications/2011_yamin/</link>

      <description>Contribution of mechanical inputs in farming is considered in terms of farm mechanization. Farm mechanization has helped in increasing the cultivated area and yield of major crops like wheat, rice and maize to 0.4%, 10.4% and 27.3% respectively by bringing barren land under cultivation (GOP, 2006). To study the present status of farm mechanization in all the districts of Punjab using GIS, data of farm machines, sowing area and wheat crop production was collected from Census Organizations for 1994-95 to 2004-05.</description>

      <title>Modeling and forecasting the sugarcane yield of Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://myaseen208.com/publications/2005_yaseen/</link>

      <description>The present study was planned to Model and forecast the sugarcane yield of Pakistan. The findings of present study are based on sugarcane yield data during the period (1947-2002). The most appropriate Model for the present study is ARIMA (2, 1, 2). Forecasting was also done up to 2008-2009. For comparison purposes, first three forecast values from 1999-2000 to 2001-2002 are compared with the actual values. Forecasts values are very close to the actual values.</description>
