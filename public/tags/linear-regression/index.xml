      <description>Lentil is a valuable human food and one of the oldest known protein rich food legumes which is also known as poor men&amp;rsquo;s meat. Owing to biotic and abiotic stresses, the crop yield is below attainable levels which are mainly attributed to pathological factors especially lentil wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lentis. It is a potential threat to lentil production not only in Pakistan but worldwide as well that can cause complete crop failure.</description>
