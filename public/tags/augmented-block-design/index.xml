      <description>The augmented block design (ABD) is commonly used in breeding programs to evaluate the performance of large number of genotypes using non-replicated new test treatments and replicated check treatments. The purpose of this design is to determine which test treatment performs better than check treatments. The objective of this study is to identifying better genotype of Mash been than check treatment under rain feed condition of Pakistan. For this purpose, the data of 125 mash been genotypes included 5 check entries were analyzed.</description>
