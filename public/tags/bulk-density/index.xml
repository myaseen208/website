      <description>Adoption of maize (Zea mays L) hybrids containing Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) transgenes and increased plant population is widespread but little scientific research exists on their interactions with production environments in the Western Maize Belt of the United States. Two pairs of near-isogenic Bt and non-Bt maize hybrids were grown under rainfed and irrigated conditions from 2008 to 2010 at target populations from 49,300 to 111,100 plants ha-1 near Mead, NE. The objective was to determine the influence of the presence/absence of Bt transgenes for European corn borer [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hï¿½bner) - ECB] and corn rootworm [Diabrotica spp.</description>
