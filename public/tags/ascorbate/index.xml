      <description>Salinity is amongst the leading abiotic stresses which adversely affects the crop productivity. It brings multiple disorders in normal plant functionality and suppresses yield up to drastic level. Under subjection to salinity, maize crop interacts differently with different environmental conditions and shows different responses. Plants interact positively, negatively and sometimes no interaction with environment for various plant traits. Genotype x Environment Interaction (GEI) of maize genotypes with three salinity levels was studied for some selected morpho-physiological traits i.</description>
