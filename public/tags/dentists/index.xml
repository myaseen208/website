The aging of the dental work- force has implications for both patients and dentists, especially those in rural and underserved areas.Anecdotal information regarding dental workforce trends indicates that students from rural communities are more likely to practice in rural communities than are students from urban areas.Although the medical literature supports this premise relative to physicians, there are no data to verify this statement relative to dentistry.
