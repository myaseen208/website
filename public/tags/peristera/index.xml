      <description>Modelling fertility patterns of a population has gained popularity among the demographers in recent years. This article investigates the fertility patterns of Pakistan and its urban and rural regions. The analysis of age specific fertility rates (ASFRs) has demonstrated high fertility in rural population as compared to urban and overall Pakistan population during the period 1984-2007. Substantial respective decreases of 44.98%, 48.72% and 46.76% in total fertility rates (TFRs) of rural, urban and overall Pakistan have been observed during the past 23 years.</description>
