      <description>Genotype (G) and environment (E) interaction effects for grain quality are important to processors of white sorghum grain. The objective of this study was to analyze the genotype plus genotype-by-environment interaction effect (GGE) for grain attributes of 11white-grained sorghum G produced in 12 E in Nebraska. Environments included combinations of 4 locations, and two years, water regimes and N levels. GGE analysis can help processors of sorghum grain by selection of G and E to meet kernel mass, starch concentration and viscosity desired for different uses since GGE accounted for 18 to 23% of total variation, but not for yield and hardness since GGE accounted for &amp;lt; 5% of total variation.</description>
