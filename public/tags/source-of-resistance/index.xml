      <description>The research was conducted for the source of resistance against Alternaria leaf spot disease of brassica. In the current research, ten varieties/ advanced lines were evaluated in 2016-17 and 2017-18 against this disease using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) at the experimental research area of Oilseeds Research Institute, Ayub Agricultural Research Institute Faisalabad. During 2016, three advanced lines (RBN-13017, RBN-13022 and RBN-13029) exhibited moderately resistant response with 22.33%, 18.42% and 13.</description>
