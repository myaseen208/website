      <description>The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship, if any, of a dental student&amp;rsquo;s 1) state of residency and 2) gender to his or her practice location in a rural Nebraska community after graduation. Previous research has demonstrated that dental students generally locate their practices near their place of rearing and that male graduates are more likely than female graduates to locate in rural areas. Dental student data for all University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry graduates from 1989 to 2008 (n=879) were analyzed.</description>
