# Introduction
## Statistics
> * Statistics is the science of uncertainty & variability
  * Statistics turns data into information
  * Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom
  * Data Driven Decisions (3Ds)
  * Statistics is the interpretation of Science
  * Statistics is the Art & Science of learning from data

&nbsp;

## Variable
> * Characteristic that may vary from individual to individual
  * Height, Weight, CGPA etc


&nbsp;

## Measurement
> * Process of assigning numbers or labels to objects or states in accordance with logically accepted rules


```{r, label = TrafficSignals, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Measurement", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/myaseen208/material/raw/main/TrafficSignals.jpg")
```

&nbsp;

## Measurement Scales
> * **Nominal Scale:** Obersvations may be classified into mutually exclusive & exhaustive classes or categories
* **Ordinal Scale:** Obersvations may be ranked
* **Interval Scale:** Difference between obersvations is meaningful
* **Ratio Scale:** Ratio between obersvations is meaningful & true zero point

```{r, label = MS, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Measurement Scales", out.width = "100%"}

## Numerical Summaries

###  Example
> The following data shows the ID, Gender (Male, Female), Age, Race (Mexican American, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, Other Hispanic, Other/Mixed), BMI, and BMI.Cat (Under Weight, Normal Weight, Over Weight, Obese) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The survey is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and data are publicly available at: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm) . NHANES data are reported in well over one thousand peer-reviewed journal publications every year.

# An Introduction to R

>**R** is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, bioinformatics, visualization and general computing. **R** provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The latest version of **R**  can be obtained from [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
