**Background:** Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that causes the social breakdown of relationships with others. Patients with schizophrenia interpret reality and verbal communication in an abnormal way. They experience great difficulty in building and maintaining of social relationships within society. They also experience barriers in communication and motivation that hinder their readiness for treatment. The willingness of patients with schizophrenia to be treated improves mental illness, social support and other health-related issues. The main purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between social support and willingness for treatment in patients with Schizophrenia.

**Methods:** The qualitative research approach was used to solicit and capture more in-depth information from participants. The research design was phenomenological in nature. A cross-sectional survey method was employed. The sample consisted of twenty female patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, seven psychiatrists, and seven psychologists. A semi-structured interview guide was developed to collect the data. The interview guide covered three themes. The first theme included four questions for patients with schizophrenia. The second theme consisted of six questions for the psychiatrists and the third theme included two questions for the psychologists. Interview data were analysed through frame workanalysis.

**Results:** The results of the study showed that social support plays an essential role in the improvement of patients with schizophrenia. Psychiatrists with the help of medication and therapies reduce the negativity and anxiety level of patients and motivate patients to accept treatment. Through counseling, psychologists help patients with schizophrenia build social skills such as the ability to engage in eye contact.

**Conclusion:** It is revealed that the social support is closely related to the willingness for treatment in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, social support is recommended in the course of treatment of patients with schizophrenia.
