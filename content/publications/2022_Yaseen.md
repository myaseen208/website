The augmented block design (ABD) is commonly used in breeding programs to evaluate the performance of large number of genotypes using non-replicated new test treatments and replicated check treatments. The purpose of this design is to determine which test treatment performs better than check treatments. The objective of this study is to identifying better genotype of Mash been than check treatment under rain feed condition of Pakistan. For this purpose, the data of 125 mash been genotypes included 5 check entries were analyzed. The experiment was conducted in augmented block design using 6 blocks in rain feed condition of Pakistan and data of different attribute were recorded. The analysis showed that the treatment effects (adjusted) are significant for all attributes. However, for all attribute other than the number of seeds/pod, the adjusted block effects are non-significant, indicating that the evaluated blocks are homogeneous. Only three principal components were considered, first component explained 33.85% of variation and 21.85%, 17.51% explained by PC2 and PC3 respectively for the first season whereas in the second season 33.62%, 23.43%, and 16. 86% variation described with respect to the first, second, and third principal components. First PC designated as a component of productivity, second as component of pod appearance while third designed as a component of physical appearances. All attributes showed significant and positive association with other attributes, only significantly negative association was among number of pods/plant and100-seeds weight.
