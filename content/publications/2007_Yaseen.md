The present study was planned to Model and forecast the sugarcane yield of Pakistan. The findings of present study are based on sugarcane yield data during the period (1947-2002). The most appropriate Model for the present study is ARIMA (2, 1, 2). Forecasting was also done up to 2008-2009. For comparison purposes, first three forecast values from 1999-2000 to 2001-2002 are compared with the actual values. Forecasts values are very close to the actual values.
