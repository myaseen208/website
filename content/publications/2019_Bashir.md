The research was conducted for the source of resistance against Alternaria leaf spot disease of brassica. In the current research, ten varieties/ advanced lines were evaluated in 2016-17 and 2017-18 against this disease using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) at the experimental research area of Oilseeds Research Institute, Ayub Agricultural Research Institute Faisalabad. During 2016, three advanced lines (RBN-13017, RBN-13022 and RBN-13029) exhibited moderately resistant response with 22.33%, 18.42% and 13.76% disease incidence respectively under rating 2 whereas two advanced lines namely KN-294 (34.56%) and 14CBN009 (42.99%) expressed a moderately susceptible response (rating 3). Similarly, four advanced lines/ varieties showed susceptible response with (66.54%), (54.28%), (64.77%) and (60.12) percent disease incidence while KJ-159 was used as spreader that expressed highly susceptible response with 92.14 % disease incidence. During 2017-18 four varieties/ advanced lines namely KN-279, 14CBN001, Faisal Canola and Rohi Sarson exhibited susceptible response with (68.84%), (56.38%), (66.97%) and (58.22) percent disease incidence (rating 4) whereas two advanced lines such as KN-294 (31.86%) and 14CBN009 (40.09%) showed moderately susceptible response (rating 3). Likewise, three advanced lines exhibited moderately resistant response with 24.63%, 19.82% and 12.06% disease incidence respectively under rating 2. It was concluded that source of resistance is the most economical management strategy for the farmers against Alternaria Leaf Spot Disease of brassica.
