Functionalities to compute model based genetic components i.e. genotypic variance, phenotypic variance and heritability for given traits of different genotypes from replicated data using methodology explained by Burton, G. W. & Devane, E. H. (1953) (<doi:10.2134/agronj1953.00021962004500100005x>) and Allard, R.W. (2010, ISBN:8126524154).
