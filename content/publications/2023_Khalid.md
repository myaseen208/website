The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which pledges to “leave no one behind,” emphasizes on promoting full and equal participation of all vulnerable and marginalized population segments in national development efforts, including persons with disabilities (PWDs). There is mounting evidence globally that differently abled people are disproportionately more vulnerable to both monetary and multi-dimensional poverty and require urgent support in terms of targeted social protection measures. The present paper presents a situation analysis and estimates of the population of PWDs across Pakistan, using different available data sources. It outlines the social protection framework for PWDs in Pakistan, with a special focus on support being extended to this population segment through the country’s largest social protection program the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) different BISP programs. It also provides recommendations for further increasing social protection coverage for this vulnerable population segment through developing synergies with other social protection programs for greater impact.
