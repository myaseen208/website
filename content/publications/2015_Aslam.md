Salinity is amongst the leading abiotic stresses which adversely affects the  crop productivity. It brings multiple disorders in normal plant functionality and 
suppresses yield up to drastic level. Under subjection to salinity, maize crop interacts differently with different environmental conditions and shows different responses. Plants interact positively, negatively and sometimes no interaction with environment for various plant traits. Genotype x Environment Interaction (GEI) of maize genotypes with three salinity levels was studied for some selected morpho-physiological traits i.e. root shoot ratio, cholorphyll a, cholorphyll b, B-carotenoids, 
ascorbic acid, root density and leaf temperature using AMMI biplot analysis. OH41, OH28, OH8, USSR40 and WM13RA for root shoot ratio (RSR) and A556 for B-carotenoids (BCart) were proved stable genotypes whereas; all other genotype interacted with stressed conditions either positively or negatively. Ascorbic acid and B-carotenoid contents were proved good indicators of salt tolerance
in maize plant. AMMI biplot analysis proved to be an effective technique for study of GEI. Stable genotypes can be regarded for further breeding program.
