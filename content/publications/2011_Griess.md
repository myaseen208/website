Grain processors would benefi t from information about the production environment and the infl uences of the sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] hybrid on food-grade fl our properties. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of environment and hybrid on rapid-visco-analysis (RVA) fl our properties of commercially available food-grade sorghum. A randomized complete block experiment was planted in 12 environments, which included the 2004 and 2005 growing seasons and irrigated and dryland water regimes in eastern, central, and west central Nebraska, and a dryland, low-N environment in eastern Nebraska. The environment accounted for 71-85% of the total variation in RVA parameters, while the hybrid accounted for 11-23% and the environmentby- hybrid interaction, 1-3%. Unfortunately, the results of this experiment suggest that it is diffi cult to predict the effect that environment will have on resulting sorghum-fl our parameters. Although of secondary importance in terms of total variation in sorghum-fl our RVA properties, the choice of hybrid predictably and signifi - cantly contributes to sorghum-starch viscosity properties. Food-grade hybrids were grouped based on viscosity properties into those best suited for dry-mill and alkaline-cooked products (Asgrow Orbit; Sorghum Partners NK1486) and those best suited for porridge, consumable alcohol, and ethanol production (Kelly Green Seeds KG6902; NC+ Hybrids 7W92; Asgrow Eclipse; and Fontanelle W-1000). These results were consistent with those previously reported for grain density.
