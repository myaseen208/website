Knowledge of economic threshold level and growth habits of weeds in chickpea is essential to implement timely, effective, and economical weed control treatments. The effect of weed density on growth and yield performance in chickpea using dragon spurge as a test weed was investigated for 2 consecutive yr. Dragon spurge density levels of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 plants m???2 were compared with weed-free plots. Each increment in densities of dragon spurge from 5 to 40 plants m???2 reduced plant height, number of fruits, seeds, and dry weight per plant. Chickpea grain yield losses varied between 1 to 63% with dragon spurge density ranging from 5 to 40 plants m???2. The seed protein content of chickpea was found to be significantly reduced above a weed density of 25 plants m???2. Maximum N, P and K uptake by dragon spurge was 1,520, 1,020, and 7,350 mg m???2, respectively. Thus, dragon spurge should be controlled at densities above 5 plants m???2 to achieve optimum chickpea yield. Nomenclature: Chickpea, Cicer arietinum L.; Euphorbia dracunculoides Lam.
