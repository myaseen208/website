The aim of the present study was to identify the drivers of inefficiencies existent in nurses' and paramedics' work and to detect the factors liable for decline in this profession, especially nursing.
All the public sector hospitals of District Rahim Yar Khan were included in the study. A sample of size 118 was selected from the population of 1296 nurses and paramedics by the stratified random sampling technique. The analysis was done in R-programming.
Comparisons made were made showing that female nurses/
paramedics go through a tough time routine and time poverty as compared to their male counterpart which seems to be the cause of deterioration in this profession in the perspective of Pakistani society.
