Cardiovascular diseases have become common problem in developing countries including Pakistan. Survival analysis is a statistical technique used to model the time duration to until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. In this study, we modeled the survival rates of cardiovascular patients who had heart attacks using survival analysis and log-rank test was used to compare the survival rates across gender. It was observed that the survival rates were not the same across gender. Male patients had less chances of survival as compared to female patients. The data have been collected from cardiology center, District Headquarter (DHQ) Hospital, Faisalabad included 106 cardiovascular patients who had heart attacks were observed to check survival rate from which 60 were males and 46 were females.
