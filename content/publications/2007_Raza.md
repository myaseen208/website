The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal helminthiasis in ruminants in an irrigated area of lower Punjab (Pakistan). For this purpose, 100 faecal samples were collected from sheep, goats, cattle and buffaloes. Parasitological procedures including direct and indirect methods (sedimentation and floatation) and coproculture were used for the identification of helminths. The overall prevalence of helminthiasis was 51% in cattle, 47% in buffaloes, 62% in sheep and 52% in goats, with nematodes being the most common helminths. The prevalence of helminths was higher in young animals compared with adults in cattle (P < 0.0001), buffaloes (P < 0.0001), sheep (P < 0.059) and goats (P = 0.010). The prevalence of different species of helminths also varied in different age groups, with Toxocara vitulorum being higher in calves than adults both in cattle (P = 0.017) and buffaloes (P < 0.0001). Sex-wise prevalence of helminths was higher in males than females for buffaloes (P < 0.0001) and sheep (P = 0.014) in contrast to cattle and goats.
