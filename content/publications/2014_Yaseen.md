Genotype (G) and environment (E) interaction effects for grain quality are important to processors of white sorghum grain. The objective of this study was to analyze the genotype plus genotype-by-environment interaction effect (GGE) for grain attributes of 11white-grained sorghum G produced in 12 E in Nebraska. Environments included combinations of 4 locations, and two years, water regimes and N levels. GGE analysis can help processors of sorghum grain by selection of G and E to meet kernel mass, starch concentration and viscosity desired for different uses since GGE accounted for 18 to 23% of total variation, but not for yield and hardness since GGE accounted for < 5% of total variation. Heavy kernel mass sorghum grain would be best using Pioneer 84Y00 or Dekalb DK41-44 produced at Mead. Fontanelle W-1000, Kelly Green Seeds KG6902 and Asgrow Eclipse would produce high starch concentrations in environments with adequate N supply. Macia produced high peak and soft final viscosities, and high peak temperatures. Asgrow Eclipse produced low peak and hard final viscosities, while NC+7W92 produced low peak time and pasting temperatures. Pioneer 84Y00was more stable than the other genotypes for kernel mass, high peak viscosity and final viscosity, while Asgrow Eclipse was more stable for low peak viscosity and peak time. GGE analysis can help processors in selection of the best production areas and genotypes for different end uses of sorghum grain, but is limited by the ability to characterize and control environments.
