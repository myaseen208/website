The current research was conducted to exploit the adaptability/resistance status of different sesame varieties/advanced lines of sesame germplasm against charcoal rot under different environmental conditions through AMMI Biplot analysis. Ten varieties/advanced lines of sesame viz., TS-5, 10003, 40009, 50009, 50011, 50022, 16001, 40004, Black Till and TH-6 were collected from Ayub Agricultural Research Institute (AARI), Faisalabad, Pakistan. The seeds of sesame varieties/advanced
lines were sown at six different locations namely Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh, Piplan, Bhakhar, Mandi Baha Uddin and Bahawalpur with three replications under Randomized Complete Block Design. Statistical analysis was performed through R-statistical software, version 3.5.1. Combined analysis of variance was used to assess the level of significance whereas Genotype × Environment Interaction Table was used to separate means of data regarding disease incidence. Further, Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) Biplot was performed for stability analysis. Five sesame genotypes namely 40004, 40009, 50011, 50022, Black Till and TS-5, respectively, expressed resistant response at various locations with varying disease incidences whereas 50009 exhibited moderately susceptible response at Bhakkar, M.B. Din, Piplan and Toba Tek Singh with (36.76, 39.71, 40.95 and 46.98% disease incidences respectively. Likewise, two sesame advanced lines 10003
and 16001 expressed susceptible response at all locations with disease incidences of 64.547, 67.050, 66.75, 72.54, 77.38, 71.56% and 74.42, 72.03, 77.20, 77.27, 65.55, 69.06% correspondingly. It was concluded that resistant varieties are the most economical management strategy for farmers against charcoal rot of sesame.
