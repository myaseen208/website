Majority of uncomplicated distal ureteric stones can be managed conservatively by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), hormones, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, and alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker drugs. Oedema and ureteral spasm are two important contributing factors causing retention of stone. Objective of this study was to assess the outcome of using (NSAIDS) and
alpha blockers in the conservative management of distal ureteric stones. Total number of patients in this prospective study was 120 and study period was 15 months. Patients were divided into two groups, A & B. Group A patients were managed by NSAIDS alone. Group B patients received NSAIDS along with alpha blocker doxazosin. Use of alpha blocker along with NSAIDS proved to be better than the use of NSAIDS alone. Stone expulsion rate was greater in group B. similarly duration of treatment, need for hospitalization, pain episodes, use of analgesics and surgical interventions were less in group B.
