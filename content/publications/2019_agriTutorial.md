Example software for the analysis of data from designed experiments, especially agricultural crop experiments. The basics of the analysis of designed experiments are discussed using real examples from agricultural field trials. A range of statistical methods using a range of R statistical packages are exemplified . The experimental data is made available as separate data sets for each example and the R analysis code is made available as example code. The example code can be readily extended, as required.
