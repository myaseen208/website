The aim of the present study was to identify the drivers of
inefficiencies existent in nurses' and paramedics' work and to detect
the factors liable for decline in this profession, especially nursing.
All the public sector hospitals of District Rahim Yar Khan were
included in the study. A sample of size 118 was selected from the
population of 1296 nurses and paramedics by the stratified random
sampling technique. The analysis was done in R-programming.
Comparisons made were made showing that female nurses/
paramedics go through a tough time routine and time poverty as
compared to their male counterpart which seems to be the cause of
deterioration in this profession in the perspective of Pakistani
society.
